```
FK - "fast" - triogonometry approach
   - Denavitâ€“Hartenberg
IK - basic approach
```

#### Program was created as a final project of course: Object-Oriented Programming
**Course aims**: Understand the features of object-oriented programming and methodology for designing and building program using object oriented programming. Learn to use C++ and C# programming languages for the implementation of projects that use OOP technology.

### Note
This is a program that has python programming access features, so it may not be completely optimal. Main goal was created modular and simple program in C++, for testing approach of IK and FK for 2-link SCARA robot. Inspiration came from lab.n.3 [VRM Course](https://github.com/rparak/Programming-for-robots-and-manipulators-VRM/tree/main/Lab/3).

### Dependencies for build
